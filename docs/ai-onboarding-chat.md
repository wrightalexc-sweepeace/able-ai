# AI Conversational Onboarding Integration Plan

## Overview
The onboarding process will use an AI model (e.g., Gemini) to guide gig workers users through onboarding in a conversational, chat-like manner, collecting structured data at each step.

## Data Inputs
- Onboarding step context (e.g., current step, previous answers)
- User responses

## AI Model Usage
- **Model:** Gemini (e.g., gemini-2.0-flash)
- **Integration:**
  - Use the Firebase AI SDK as in other features.
  - For each step, send a prompt with the current context and user input.

## Prompt Example (per step)
```
You are an onboarding assistant. For the following step, ask the user for the required information in a friendly, conversational tone. When the user responds, extract the relevant data and return it as JSON. After each step, ask the user to confirm the extracted data.

Step: {step}
Previous Answers: {previousAnswers}
User Input: {userInput}
```

## Response Format
```json
{
  "field": "mainSkill",
  "value": "Bartending",
  "confirmationPrompt": "You said your main skill is Bartending. Is this correct? (yes/no)"
}
```

## Confirmation Flow
- After each step, show the extracted data and ask the user to confirm or edit.
- Only proceed when the user confirms.

## Future Extensibility
- Add support for file uploads, calendar pickers, etc.
- Multi-step summary and final confirmation
- Multi-language support 

## Refined Conversational Flow for Worker Onboarding

- The onboarding chat collects data step-by-step from an initially empty user profile.
- For each step, the AI should:
  1. **Vary the question** based on previous answers (context-aware prompts).
  2. **Extract the answer** from the user's response, or ask for clarification if the answer is unclear.
  3. **Confirm the extracted value** with the user, e.g.:
     > For [field], you answered: "[extracted answer]". Please confirm I got it right (yes/no).
  4. **If the answer is unclear**, ask for clarification up to 3 times. If still unclear, offer to save the answer as-is and inform the user they can update it later in their profile.
  5. **Ask the user if the step is finished** and if they want to continue to the next one.

## Example Step-by-Step AI Prompt

```
You are an onboarding assistant for gig workers. For each step, ask the user for the required information in a friendly, conversational tone, using previous answers as context. When the user responds, try to extract the relevant data. If the answer is unclear, ask for clarification (up to 3 times). After extracting the answer, confirm with the user: "For [field], you answered: '[extracted answer]'. Please confirm I got it right (yes/no)." If the user confirms, ask if the step is finished and if you can continue. If not, repeat clarification or offer to save as-is and inform the user they can update it later.
```

## Example Step Response Schema
```json
{
  "field": "bio",
  "value": "I have been a bartender for three years, and I love creating new cocktails and meeting new people.",
  "confirmationPrompt": "For your work experience, you answered: 'I have been a bartender for three years, and I love creating new cocktails and meeting new people.' Please confirm I got it right (yes/no).",
  "clarificationCount": 1,
  "isConfirmed": false,
  "canContinue": false
}
```
- `clarificationCount`: Number of clarification attempts so far.
- `isConfirmed`: Whether the user has confirmed the extracted value.
- `canContinue`: Whether the user is ready to move to the next step.

## Example Final Submission Schema
```json
{
  "bio": "...",
  "specialSkills": "...",
  "desiredHourlyRate": 15,
  "location": "...",
  "travelRadius": "30 miles",
  "availability": ["2024-07-01", "2024-07-02"],
  "stripeConnected": true,
  "introVideoUrl": "https://...",
  "references": [
    { "name": "Manager A", "contact": "manager@example.com" },
    { "name": "Colleague B", "contact": "colleague@example.com" }
  ],
  "shareLink": "https://...",
  "agreedToTerms": true
}
```

## Gemini Library Integration Example

```ts
import { getAI, getGenerativeModel, Schema } from "@firebase/ai";

const ai = getAI(firebaseApp, { backend: new GoogleAIBackend() });

const onboardingStepSchema = Schema.object({
  field: Schema.string(),
  value: Schema.string(),
  confirmationPrompt: Schema.string(),
  clarificationCount: Schema.optional(Schema.number()),
  isConfirmed: Schema.optional(Schema.boolean()),
  canContinue: Schema.optional(Schema.boolean()),
});

const onboardingSummarySchema = Schema.object({
  bio: Schema.string(),
  specialSkills: Schema.string(),
  desiredHourlyRate: Schema.number(),
  location: Schema.string(),
  travelRadius: Schema.string(),
  availability: Schema.array(Schema.string()),
  stripeConnected: Schema.boolean(),
  introVideoUrl: Schema.string(),
  references: Schema.array(
    Schema.object({
      name: Schema.string(),
      contact: Schema.string(),
    })
  ),
  shareLink: Schema.string(),
  agreedToTerms: Schema.boolean(),
});

const model = getGenerativeModel(ai, {
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20",
  generationConfig: {
    responseMimeType: "application/json",
    responseSchema: onboardingStepSchema,
  },
});
```

## Quick Test Prompt for Chat UI
```
SYSTEM: You are an onboarding assistant for gig workers. For each step, extract the relevant field, value, and confirmationPrompt as JSON. If the answer is unclear, ask for clarification up to 3 times, then offer to save as-is. At the end, return a summary object with all fields.
USER: {step, previousAnswers, userInput here}
```

## Future Extensibility
- Add support for file uploads (e.g., certifications, ID).
- Multi-step summary and final confirmation.
- Multi-language support.
- Integrate with background check or verification APIs.
- Allow user to skip/revisit steps.

## Integration Plan for `app/user/[userId]/worker/onboarding/page.tsx`
1. **Export the AI Instance**
   - In `app/lib/firebase/clientApp.ts`, export the `ai` instance.

2. **Create the Agent File**
   - In `app/lib/agents/`, create `workerOnboardingAgent.ts`.

3. **Implement the Agent Function**
   - Import `ai`, define the model and schema as above, and export a function (e.g., `generateOnboardingStep` and `generateOnboardingSummary`).

4. **Use the Agent in the Page**
   - In `app/user/[userId]/worker/onboarding/page.tsx`, import and use the agent function:
     ```ts
     import { generateOnboardingStep } from "@/app/lib/agents/workerOnboardingAgent";
     // ...
     const aiResponse = await generateOnboardingStep(prompt);
     // Use aiResponse to update chat state
     ```

5. **Extend as Needed**
   - Add support for more fields, richer feedback, or multi-turn conversations as your onboarding evolves.
